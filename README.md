Egghead.io AngularJS Practice Examples
================

A simple website I put together for learning AngularJS.  I'm currently in the process of working through all of the demos on the http://www.egghead.io website.  I've completed over half of the examples at this point, so it is still a work in process.

After downloading the repository, open the "index.html" file and start there to view the examples.  There, I have created a complete index for explicitly that purpose.

Enjoy!
